You can configure Page Notes to automatically show notes for a web page by changing "Automatically show notes pop-up" setting under 'Advanced Settings'. There are 3 possible values of this setting:

- Never
    - Notes popup is not shown.
- Only for page-level notes (recommended):
    - Notes popup is shown for the pages that have page-specific notes.
- For site-level notes as well:
    - Notes popup is shown for all pages that have notes, either through page-level notes or site-level notes.
