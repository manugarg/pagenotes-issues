You can configure Page Notes to automatically show notes for a web page by changing the "Automatically show notes pop-up" setting in the options page. There are 3 possible values of this setting:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Never (default) | Notes popup is not shown. |
| Only for page-level notes | Notes popup is shown for the pages that have page-specific notes. |
| For site-level notes as well | Notes popup is shown for all pages that have notes, either through page-level notes or site-level notes. |
