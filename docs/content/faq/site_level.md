Site-level notes are applied to all pages with the same hostname. For example, if you add
a site-level note for `github.com`, those notes will apply to all pages on github.com,
including e.g. `https://github.com/manugarg/pagenotes-issues`.

You can mark a note as site-level when you edit it. You can also change the default setting
through the options page.
