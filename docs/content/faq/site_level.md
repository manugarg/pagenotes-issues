Site-level notes are applied to all pages with the same hostname. For example, if you add a site-level note for `github.com`, that note will apply to all pages on `github.com`, including `https://github.com/manugarg/pagenotes-issues`, for example. If a page has both page-level and site-level notes, the page-level notes take priority.

You can mark a note as site-level when you edit it. You can also change the default setting through the options page.
