Ever needed to note down something about a webpage e.g. login id, frequent flyer
number, membership number, tracking id etc. Something that you want to remember
when you visit that page again.

Page notes lets you do that and much more in a slick way. Your notes can live in
the cloud allowing you to be free of the device. It's secure: data stays in your
browser and in your Google drive; you can encrypt your notes if you want that
extra level of security. There's more. See below for full features list.

### Install

- [Chromium based browsers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-notes/omjdheidbhoghpfdnndkgoelfiogjfla)
  (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mg-page-notes/)

### Features

- Take and access your notes with a single click.

- All notes also available through a single page to make it easy to search in
  your notes. On all notes page, filter notes by tags. Tags are added to notes
  by prefixing a word with '#'.
