<p>Ever needed to note down something about a webpage e.g. login id, frequent flyer number, membership number, tracking id etc. Something that you want to remember when you visit that page again.</p>

It's secure: data stays in your browser and in your Google drive; you can encrypt your notes if you want that extra level of security. There's more. See below for full features list.</p>
