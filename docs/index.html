        <p>
          Ever needed to note down something about a webpage e.g. login id,
          frequent flyer number, membership number, tracking id etc. Something
          that you want to remember when you visit that page again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Page notes lets you do that and much more in a slick way. Your notes
          can live in the cloud allowing you to be free of the device. It's
          secure: data stays in your browser and in your Google drive; you can
          encrypt your notes if you want that extra level of security. There's
          more. See below for full features list.

Perfect!"
